  \subsection{Problem Statement}
  \paragraph{}
  敏捷開發逐漸成為主流，其中以Scrum最為著名，然而現在卻沒有能夠讓
使用者完全倚賴的 Scrum 管理軟體。軟體系統實驗室現有的 ezScrum 系統並不 適合讓剛接觸 Scrum 的人上手，甚至對 Scrum 流程不熟悉的人容易對 Scrum 產 生錯誤的理解。此外，Scrum 的附屬行為仍然需要搭配實際的工具與活動，這 造成了資源的浪費、團隊在某些特定情況下 Scrum 活動難以順利進行。當今業 界中有名的 Jira 軟體，試圖一次將太多資訊夾雜在有限的介面中，也並未符合 Scrum 中定義的各種資訊，不僅在使用上混亂，而且對於團體的新人、甚至是 Scrum初學者，需要一次面對太大量的資訊與過於複雜的介面。

因此我們希望開發一套 Scrum 管理系統，提供一個流程動態視覺化的介 面，幫助團隊不只記錄，更可以將他們的開發流程更好的視覺化，讓新手可以 快速地理解 Scrum 的各個流程活動;老手也能輕易掌握 Scrum 運行的狀況。此 外，這個系統也需要提供數個虛擬化的 Scrum 常用工具，並提供使用者客製化 的彈性空間，使其更貼近各個團隊的使用狀況。而前述的所有軟體都缺乏一個 完整的 Dash Board 介面，讓使用者始終無法真正脫離實際的 Task Board、 Burndown Chart 等工具;因此這套系統需要提供這樣的介面，讓 Scrum 的流程 管理可以真正的虛擬化。
